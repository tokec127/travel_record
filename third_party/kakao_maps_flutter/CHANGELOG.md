# 0.2.2

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
* Unifies InfoWindow `offset`/`bodyOffset` behavior across Android, iOS, and Web.
  * Offsets are now interpreted as logical pixels (+x right, +y down) on every platform. Previously Android/iOS passed the values straight to the native SDK, which interprets them in 2x-reference pixels, so the same value moved the info window only half as far on mobile as on web.
  * `offset` and `bodyOffset` are now combined into a single body shift. Previously `offset` was ignored on all platforms.
  * `bodyOffset` now also applies to text-only info windows on Android/iOS (previously it only applied to custom GUI bodies).
* (iOS) Marker icons are now anchored at bottom-center to match Android (`LabelStyle` anchor 0.5/1.0) and web (`kakao.maps.Marker`). The iOS SDK default was center (0.5/0.5), which rendered the same marker half an icon height lower than the other platforms.
* ⚠️ Behavior change: if your app tuned platform-specific offset values to work around the mismatch (e.g. a smaller offset on mobile), remove the workaround and pass a single logical-pixel offset for all platforms.

### 🔧 Improvements
* (iOS) Updated KakaoMapsSDK to 2.12.19 (CocoaPods, SPM) to fix intermittent native crashes during map rendering reported via Firebase Crashlytics (`AsyncDownloaderManager::confirmDiskCache` / unordered_map race). Kakao confirmed the crash spike caused by the 2026-08-10 map server data deployment is fixed in iOS 2.12.18+.
* (Android) Updated Kakao Maps SDK to 2.15.1 for the same engine/server data compatibility fix (fixed in Android 2.15.0+), plus ANR fixes during map shutdown and Fragment lifecycle handling (2.13.x).
